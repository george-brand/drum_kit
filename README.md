# drum_kit

This is a project from <b>Udemy - The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp</b>.  Drum Kit is a simple web application that allows a user to play drum sounds by either
clicking on a drum or tpying the letter corresponding to the drum on the keyboard.  This application uses the Java Script event listeners `click` and `keydown` to "listen" for a click or keystroke and play the corresponding MP3 audio file.  You can play Drum Kit [here](https://george-brand.github.io/drum_kit/).
